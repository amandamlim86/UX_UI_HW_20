  <h2>USER INTERVIEWS</h2>
  <P>We wanted a deeper understanding of how users plan their vacations, so we reached out to interview 5 people from various backgrounds who all share a similar interest in traveling. We asked them questions regarding how they research for their travel, how they collaborate on group trips, and how much time they devote to planning their vacations.</P>

They enjoy a structured schedule but are still open to a new and unique experience. The users fear disorganization will negatively impact their vacation causing them to miss out on an activity.

  <p>Following the analysis of our research, we sorted our data into a feature prioritization matrix to determine what elements would provide the best value to the customers while mutually benefitting the company. Our user journey map helped us to illustrate how the user would engage with the app and provided a narrative of our how the app solved our user's pain points. This helped us to avoid feature creep and stay on track with the true needs of our users to provide the best overall experience.

  </div>
  <div class="textCenter">
    <p>To create an app experience that allows the user to plan upcoming group travel, research popular destinations and local activities, create an interactive itinerary, and communicate with travel group members and friends within the app. The key feature components are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Account Creation - This allows the user to save itineraries, connect with friends, rate and review destinations and activities, and upload travel photos to their profile.</li>
      <li>Travel Planning - Users can create interactive itineraries based on recommended local activies and popular destinations, group suggestions, or manual input.  </li>
      <li>In-App Communication - Users can connect with friends via in-app messaging services.  Options for direct or group messaging allows users to seemlessly plan upcoming travel with multiple groups or send ideas to a friend.</li>
      <li>Destination Research - Users can research activities and excursions local to their destination for an all in one planning experience. Trusted ratings and reviews from real users provide security in itinerary development.  One click ‘favorite’ function allows for ease of browsing while saving ideas to user’s account.</li>

  <h2>WIREFRAMING & PROTOTYPING</h2>
</div>
<div class="textCenter">
  <p>After determining the user flows for the three main tasks, we started with sketching ideas for the onboarding and account creation wireframes. We then combined our sketches into the most effective low fidelity prototype and performed five quick guerilla tests to determine usability and pain points.

      <h2>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE:</h2>
      <p>Based on usability testing of our low-fidelity prototype and competitor analysis to determine feature prioritization, we developed the high fidelity wireframes to iOS standard guidelines.  We designed the app with three main tasks in mind: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an account</li>
        <li>Create a new itinerary for you and 5 of your friends with Porto, Portugual as the destination</li>
        <li>Add wine tasting to your exiting Porto itinerary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We wanted our app to convey a fun and colorful theme while still maintaining a professional level to encompass any type of user, from the business traveler to the adventure seekers. Based on a competitor analysis, we opted for a bottom navigation bar along with an expandable top menu option to create an intuitive experience with easy to find features.</p>

  <h1>FEEDBACK & ITERATIONS</h1>

<div class="textCenter">
  <p>Based on 6 rounds of usability testing of our high fidelity prototype, we determined that the ‘start new itinerary’ icon was not as intuative as we had hoped.  We also noticed that users had difficulty distinguishing the difference between the explore page and “My Trips” or “Travel Buddies”.  To overcome this problem, we provided a helpful tutorial upon the creation of the user’s account. </p>

  <h2>FEEDBACK</h2>
</div>
<div class="textCenter">
  <p>Overall, we received positive feedback from all user testers about the multifunctionality of itinerary planning, research and group collaboration. We also received valuable feedback on how we could progress the app in the future if we were continuing with this project. One thing we would consider would be to revise the hierarchy of our menus and docked navigation bars to create a better flow.

  <h2>FUTURE PROGRESSION</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Add ability to create “dual itineraries” for partial group members to plan simultaneous activities</li>
    <li>Location based services and ability to connect with a local guide at your travel destination</li>
    <li>Add ability to book activities/events in app</li>
